# Analysis of data variability and activity metrics

## The "Active Users and Activity" document tracks and analyzes user engagement over time. Here's what it does:

1. Tracks Active Users: It keeps a record of the number of unique users who are active on a daily and weekly basis.

2. Calculates Key Metrics:

3. Daily Active Users (DAU): The number of unique users active each day.

4. Weekly Active Users (WAU): The number of unique users active each week.

5. DAU/WAU Ratio: The ratio of daily active users to weekly active users, which helps in understanding user engagement and retention.

6. Analyzes User Activity: The document includes columns that track activity dates, unique user counts, and other related metrics, providing insight into user behavior and patterns.

7. Visualizes Data: Charts and pivot tables are used to visually represent the data, making it easier to spot trends and make informed decisions.

8. Performs Cohort Analysis: The document may include cohort analysis to understand the behavior and retention of groups of users over time.
